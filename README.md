**[Mission]** ==>
LetumiaOS is meant to be a simple and understandable so anyone can look at the code and understand to make OS development easier.
Testing LetumiaOS is as easy as saving the file and running the ISO in a any virtual you wish.

Update 2: Create block cursor and find functional keyboard drivers [STATUS] -> In the works!!!

Update 3: Create commands and command parsing [STATUS] -> Not yet started

Update 4: Create more headers (letstr.h, time.h, advmath.h, etc) [STATUS] -> Not yet started
