**NovaKernel_README**




**[Mission]** ==>
NovaKernel is meant to be a simple and understandable so anyone can look at the code and understand to make OS development easier.
Testing NovaKernel is as easy as saving the file and running a qemu i386 system with the kernel flag.

**[Updates]** ==>
As I believe in this project I will try and roll out updates as frequently as I can to grow the project.
